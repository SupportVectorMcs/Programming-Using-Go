# 02601_ProgrammingForScientists

A practical introduction to programming for students with little or no prior programming experience. Extensive programming assignments will illustrate programming concepts, languages, and tools. Programming assignments will generally be based on analytical tasks that might be faced by scientists and will typically include parsing, statistical analysis, simulation, and optimization. Principles of good software engineering will also be stressed. No prior programming experience is assumed, and no biology background is needed. Analytical skills and mathematical maturity are required.
